      <h3>Background info:</h3>
      <p>I currently live in Sandgate, Brisbane. I am originally from Melbourne but have been living in Brisbane for about 4 years. An opportunity to live on the Sunshine Coast originally presented itself in 2016 to work for a Radio Communications company in Mooloolaba so I left Melbourne for an exciting journey to the Sunshine Coast. I was the Technical Manager and looked after the radio communications operations for Surf lifesaving Queensland. In my tenure at this company, I was the Project/Technical Manager that upgraded the antiquated analogue radio system to a digital radio system from Mackay to Port Douglas, FNQ. The project was completed and I had to return to Brisbane for work. I worked for another communications company in Brisbane and ended up in the R&D team programming in Python and C. Unfortunately, that company closed and I ended up as an Electronics Technician at my previous employer, MST Global. I wrote several programs in Python, C and designed a few minor electronic products using Arduino and automation software. </p>
