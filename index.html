      <h3>Background info:</h3>
      <p>I currently live in Sandgate, Brisbane. I am originally from Melbourne but have been living in Brisbane for about 4 years. An opportunity to live on the Sunshine Coast originally presented itself in 2016 to work for a Radio Communications company in Mooloolaba so I left Melbourne for an exciting journey to the Sunshine Coast. I was the Technical Manager and looked after the radio communications operations for Surf lifesaving Queensland. In my tenure at this company, I was the Project/Technical Manager that upgraded the antiquated analogue radio system to a digital radio system from Mackay to Port Douglas, FNQ. The project was completed and I had to return to Brisbane for work. I worked for another communications company in Brisbane and ended up in the R&D team programming in Python and C. Unfortunately, that company closed and I ended up as an Electronics Technician at my previous employer, MST Global. I wrote several programs in Python, C and designed a few minor electronic products using Arduino and automation software.

      <h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
      <p>As a child, I always had an interest in electronics and how things worked. I was constantly disassembling electronic/electrical devices around the house, fascinated by the how and why. In those days there was no such thing as IT, the internet and personal computers didn’t exist. As I got older, I decided to pursue a career in electronics and became an Electronics Technician at 18 and started to repair devices that had microcontrollers in them. I was amazed how they worked and wanted to learn more.
      Eventually, I was able to afford a PC (ATARI 4MB ram 12Mhz bus, 16Mhz processor) and at $1600 was expensive for those days. This was for my Midi recording studio and was running QBase as the midi software. I was again fascinated by how it controlled the electronic instruments and the communications between those instruments with the QBase software.
      I finally decided to embark on the Associate Degree of Electronic Engineering to further my knowledge of microcontrollers and electronics. After completing the course, I had several different jobs working in the field of electronics. I’ve watched electromechanical devices evolve into purely electronic devices without moving parts and with increasing software/firmware running them.
      The industry of electronics, in Australia, is rapidly declining and most of the design/manufacturing is done in other parts of the world where it is cheaper. It’s a shame, as understanding electronics is not an easy skill to attain.
      I’ve been watching the decline in electronics for a few years now and decided earlier that I would teach myself the C programming language to improve my skills. I enjoyed it so much I decided to learn Python as well. Now I enjoy coding more than I enjoy electronics. I then decided I wanted to pursue a career in IT and learn the nuances of this field. I investigated several institutions and computer science courses, which lead me to RMIT’s bachelor of IT. It offered everything I needed in a course, flexibility, autonomy and content. My father and friends have been educated at RMIT and all have had successful careers.
      After completion of the bachelor of IT I’m hoping to gain employment working in the field of IoT, software development, embedded design, frontend/backend development, maybe AI/ML. I’m hoping I will have a greater understanding of IoT, computer systems, networking, AI/ML, software development to facilitate a quality outcome in my future development in these fields. My interests in IT may change as I learn more and become more aware of the direction in which IT is heading.
